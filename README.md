Winter 2024 Vacation MERN Stack Learn and Code Project.

This project makes full use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its libraries.
JavaScript libraries such as Node.js, Express.js framework and React & React-Router were used thoroughly in this project.
To use it change the MongoDB URL in the config.js file in the Backend Folder. The database is still active but you wont be able to use it.
The project also makes some use of Tailwind CSS.
